<pre><b>Madurai</b> is an ancient city, the seat of Tamil, known for its rich cultural heritage. Madurai also has a unique natural heritage, with birds forming 
an important strand of it.

Birds are perhaps the most visible part of the fauna of any place, and
Madurai is no exception. The land around Madurai city presents a
mosaic of habitats, shaped by the soil, micro-climatic conditions and
vegetation. Correspondingly, the bird life of the Madurai area is varied.

This two-part event is presented by two experienced birdwatchers from
Madurai, <b>Mr.Kumaran Sathasivam</b> and <b>Dr.T.Badrinarayanan.</b> In
the first part, they give an illustrated talk in which they discuss birds,
migration and their personal observations of birds around Madurai,
made over some three decades. They point out that the bird life of
Madurai is strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities,
After the presentation, they take us on a walk along <b>Avaniapuram tank,</b>
identifying the various birds, including migratory species.
